##Full Text Search test framework overview
- 2 steps in any complete FTS test
    index creation - default or customized index
    query phase (with result validation)
- 70% of FTS tests use the random map and/or query generation code.
- RQG is pluggable, currently works with 2 datasets - employee and wiki. More datasets can be supported by defining the "query-ables" for the same.
- Smart query enabled querying only on indexed and one/two non-indexed fields. Smart querying is also explained further below.


##Dataset loaders

Employee dataset loader is here - https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py#L221
All fields for Employee dataset are randomly generated at runtime. RQG generates query predicates for emp dataset using the same logic.

Wiki loader(only generates 30K unique docs(>2.5K)) is here - https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py#L382. Wiki data files are uploaded to AWS. These files are automatically pulled by the doc-loader if found missing in the repo. For wiki dataset, RQG does not randomly generate search terms during runtime. There's a pre-saved file of query-ables obtained by scanning the docs, on which random queries are constructed.

##Random Query Generator(RQG) (code: cd random_query_generator)

Every dataset supported by fts tests must have the corresponding queryable.py defined. Queryables are queryable data for every field of the JSON dataset based on which a query predicate can be defined/constructed. Take a look at emp_queryables.py and wiki_queryables.py. rand_query_gen.py is the actual random query generator code.
- Not only generates FTS queries but also equivalent Elastic Search queries so results can be compared for correctness.
- Based on the dataset loaded, it generates a wide range of queries on all/subset of JSON fields. A subset of the following queries can also be generated by specifying the same using query_types param -
  - match
  - match_phrase
  - numeric range
  - date range
  - boolean
  - query-string-query
  - conjunction
  - disjunction
  - wildcard
  - regexp
  - prefix
  - fuzzy
- generates any number of queries based on passed parameter, num_queries.

So RQG is usually "plugged-in" in the following fashion -

    query_type=['match_phrase', 'match', 'date_range', 'numeric_range', 'bool',
                 'conjunction', 'disjunction', 'prefix']
    query_gen = FTSESQueryGenerator(num_queries=100, query_type=query_type, dataset='all')

## Random custom map generator (code : cd random_map_generator/)
- Depending on one or more datasets loaded, generates simple to complex custom index mapping based on a custom map id, which is passed in the test-case.
- Not only generates an FTS map, but also generates an equivalent Elastic Search mapping to create 2 comparable systems so queries can yield same results.
- feeds the query-able fields into RQG. This is called smart-querying. This especially makes sense in the context of custom maps so RQG doesn't keep generating queries on fields not indexed but instead focuses on indexed fields and 0-2 non-indexed fields(for negative testing).

## How to run fts tests
Running full-text tests using testrunner is quite simple -

1. Do a 'git pull' from inside your 'testrunner' directory. All tests are run from this directory.
If you are running testrunner for the first time and you are seeing error like "module or file not found", make sure you install the following -
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install paramiko
    sudo pip install httplib2
    sudo pip install urllib

2. For node/cluster config, make sure you have a .ini file in the testrunner dir which looks like

        [global]
        username:root
        password:couchbase
        port:8091

        [membase]
        rest_username:Administrator
        rest_password:password

        [servers]
        1:_1
        2:_2
        3:_3
        4:_4

        [elastic]
        ip:172.23.105.25
        port:9200

        [_1]
        ip:172.23.106.221
        services:kv

        [_2]
        ip:172.23.106.33

        [_3]
        ip:172.23.107.125

        [_4]
        ip:172.23.107.235


pls note, the [elastic] section is of no relevance if you are not verifying your results against an elastic search node. It can be skipped.

For cluster-run, add in 127.0.0.1 and corresponding ports for Couchbase and FTS, for every instance. Your ini for cluster_run may want to look like -

    [global]
    username:root
    password:couchbase
    port:9000

    [membase]
    rest_username:Administrator
    rest_password:password

    [servers]
    1:_1
    2:_2
    3:_3

    [elastic]
    ip:10.3.4.191
    port:9200

    [_1]
    ip:127.0.0.1
    port:9000
    services:kv

    [_2]
    ip:127.0.0.1
    port:9001
    fts_port:9201

    [_3]
    ip:127.0.0.1
    port:9002
    fts_port:9202

Also it might be worth doing an enterprise build (BUILD_ENTERPRISE=1 make) to be able to cluster in node with select services.

3. All tests that have been developed so far are present in the conf/fts/*.conf files.

#####To run all tests in a conf file, run
./testrunner -i <your.ini> -c conf/fts/py-xxx.conf

#####To run a particular test,
./testrunner -i <your.ini> -t  fts.stable_topology_fts.StableTopFTS.create_simple_default_index,items=10,cluster=D,F -p
To run randomly generated queries(eg. disjunction) with validation against ES -
./testrunner -i cbft.ini -t fts.stable_topology_fts.StableTopFTS.test_query_type,items=1000,num_queries=13,query_types=disjunction,cluster=D,F,F,D+F,skip-cleanup=True,compare_es=True,kvstore=boltdb

#####Important params to pass
 cluster = specifies number of nodes in the cluster with specific services. Eg., D, F means 1 data and 1 fts node. D,F,F,D+F means 4 node cluster with 1 kv+fts node, default: D, F, F
 kvstore = boltdb/rocksdb/forestdb. default:forestdb.
 items = no of keys to load, default: 1000
 compare_es = True/False. Default: False, compare results with elastic search. Needs a valid ES instance running, specified in .ini file.
 skip-cleanup = True/False. Default: False, to indicate bucket deletion and declustering of nodes post test run
 update/delete = True/False, Default: False, indicates if the test has update/delete phase
 expires = ttl for keys in secs, Default: 0
 index_replicas = number of index replicas, default:None (product default)
 max_partitions_pindex =max partitions per pindex, default:None (product default)
 fdb_compact_interval = forestdb compaction interval in secs, defaults to None
 fdb_compact_threshold = foresdb compaction threshold in %, defaults to None

More such params and default values can be found at https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/fts/fts_base.py#L1848-L1910 (see init_parameters()  if line numbers do not match)
